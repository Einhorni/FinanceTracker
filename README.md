# Finance-Tracker C# Learning Project

There are lots of printables and excel tables for budgeting and keeping an overview of ones finances, incomes and expenses.
Although they are great, I want to write a budgeting app (not a banking app) that does the same but is way less complicated to maintain and use for user.

### Simple Finance Tracker (console app)
* adding accounts and saving them to a txt file
* transfer money between two accounts and save them as transactions
* make transcactions (income / expenses) and save them in a text file
* Load accounts and transactions and display them

### Planned
* write tests
* write try/catch blocks for I/Os
* create a MVC web app for easier handling

### Programming concepts included 
* Basic sytnax and classes, inheritance
* Switches, if-statements and loops
* IO, repositories, interfaces
* Dependency injection, writing a Service
* Seperated Logic from UI, only accessible through a service
