# Finance-Tracker C# Learning Project

There are lots of printables and excel tables for budgeting and keeping an overview of ones finances, incomes and expenses.
Although they are great, I want to write a budgeting app (not a banking app) that does the same but is way less complicated to maintain and use for user.

### Simple Finance Tracker (console app)
* Add accounts and saving them -to a txt file-
* Transfer money between two accounts and save it as transactions 
* Make transcactions (expenses) and save them -in a text file-
* Load accounts and transactions and display them

### Planned
* Be able to enter income
* Code clean-up
* Write tests
* Create a MVC web app for easier handling

### In Progress
* Be able to enter income
* Show other accountname when displaying account to account transfers

### Programming concepts included 
* Basic sytnax and classes, inheritance
* Switches, if-statements and loops
* IO with try/catch blocks, repositories, interfaces
* Dependency injection, writing a Service
* Seperated UI from a combined Logic & DataAccess Layer which is only accessible through a service
* Implemented a database with async functionality
* Used extension methods for mapping
